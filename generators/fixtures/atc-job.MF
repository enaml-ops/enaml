description: |
  The ATC (Air Traffic Controller) provides UI and API access. It is
  responsible for scheduling builds and detecting versions of your resources.

templates:
  atc_ctl.erb: bin/atc_ctl

packages:
  - pid_utils
  - atc
  - fly
  - generated_signing_key

consumes:
- name: db
  type: postgresql
  optional: true

provides:
- name: atc
  type: atc
  properties:
  - bind_port

properties:
  bind_ip:
    description: |
      IP address on which the ATC should listen for HTTP traffic.
    default: 0.0.0.0

  bind_port:
    description: |
      Port on which the ATC should listen for HTTP traffic.
    default: 8080

  external_url:
    description: |
      Externally reachable URL of the ATCs. Required for OAuth.

      Typically this is the URL that you as a user would use to reach your CI.
      For multiple ATCs it would go to some sort of load balancer.

  peer_url:
    description: |
      Address used internally to reach the ATC. This will be auto-generated
      using the IP of each ATC VM if not specified.

      Note that this refers to an *individual ATC*, not the whole cluster. This
      property is only useful if you're deploying in a way that cannot
      autodetect its own IP, e.g. a `bosh-init` deployment.

      You should otherwise leave this value blank.

  publicly_viewable:
    description: |
      Allow viewing of pipelines as an anonymous user. Destructive operations
      still require auth, and the output of builds will only be visible if
      their job is configured with `public: true`.

      This is useful for open-source projects, or as a convenience to make
      monitoring your pipeline status easier.
    default: false

  development_mode:
    description: |
      Loosen up security for development purposes. This allows the ATC to be
      configured with no authentication methods.
    default: false

  basic_auth_username:
    description: |
      Username for HTTP basic auth.
    default: ""

    description: |
      Password for HTTP basic auth, in plaintext.
    default: ""

  github_auth.client_id:
    description: |
      GitHub client ID to use for OAuth.

      The application must be configured with its callback URL as
      `{external_url}/auth/github/callback` (replacing `{external_url}`
      with the actual value).
    default: ""

  github_auth.client_secret:
    description: |
      GitHub client secret to use for OAuth.

      The application must be configured with its callback URL as
      `{external_url}/auth/github/callback` (replacing `{external_url}`
      with the actual value).
    default: ""

  github_auth.authorize:
    default: []
    description: |

    - user: user1
    - user: user2

  default_check_interval:

    default: 1m

  resource_cache_cleanup_interval:
    description: |
      The interval, in Go duration format (1m = 1 minute), on which to check
      for and release old caches of resource versions.
    default: 30s

  old_resource_grace_period:
    description: |
